# Information Retrieval Course - Assignments

Welcome to the Information Retrieval (IR) course assignments repository! This repository encapsulates the comprehensive learning outcomes of my journey through this challenging and intellectually stimulating course. Designed to provide in-depth knowledge and a thorough understanding of information retrieval systems, this course has been both demanding and rewarding.

Here, you will find my solutions of the coding assignments meticulously crafted by Professor Fattane Zarrinkalam(https://www.uoguelph.ca/ceps/people/fattane-zarrinkalam). These assignments aim to deepen your grasp of various IR models, algorithms, and evaluation techniques.

# Course Overview
The Information Retrieval course delves into the core principles and advanced techniques essential for building and evaluating information retrieval systems. The curriculum covers a broad spectrum of topics, including but not limited to:

- Boolean Retrieval: Implementation and analysis of Boolean retrieval models for precise query handling.
- Vector Space Model: Understanding and applying the vector space model for document representation and retrieval.
- Probabilistic Retrieval Models: Exploring probabilistic models like the BM25 for ranking documents based on likelihood.
- Evaluation Metrics: Comprehensive study of evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, F-measure, and Mean Average Precision (MAP).
- Text Processing Techniques: Techniques for text preprocessing, including tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.
- Web Search and Crawling: Insights into web search architectures, indexing, and web crawling algorithms.

These assignments are designed to challenge your problem-solving skills and enhance your practical expertise in information retrieval.

Feel free to explore each assignment and its corresponding solutions. Happy coding!
